# Energy Rush: Solar Sprint

A cooperative multiplayer game focused on renewable energy management and team coordination. Players work together to collect energy from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro), manage obstacles (environmental hazards, system failures, demand spikes), and coordinate as a team with different roles (Energy Collectors, Engineers, Dispatcher, Monitor).

The game is inspired by Eco (sustainability), Factorio (resource management), and Overcooked (cooperative action). It features detailed energy collection rules, obstacle management systems, and team roles & collaboration mechanics.

The implementation plan is divided into phases:
1. Game Design Finalization & Prototyping
2. Technical Foundation & Core Feature Development
3. Feature Expansion, UI/UX Implementation, and Iteration
4. Testing & Deployment

The tech stack includes options for Phaser.js (2D) or Unity (3D), with JavaScript/TypeScript, WebGL, Node.js, WebSocket, and MongoDB.
