[2025-05-13 10:45:46] - ## AI Integration Patterns

Based on the game specifications, the following AI integration patterns are planned for the game:

1. **Dynamic Obstacles Generation**: Using AI to generate random events (e.g., storms, equipment failures)

2. **Code Generation**: Using GitHub Copilot to help write scripts for:
   - Energy collection mechanics
   - Obstacle handling
   - Grid management
   - System repairs (in-game mechanic)

3. **Asset Creation**: Using MidJourney to generate visuals for energy sources and game elements

4. **Testing**: Using AI tools to simulate edge cases and test game scenarios

5. **Memory Bank**: Using Roo Code Memory Bank to maintain context across development sessions
