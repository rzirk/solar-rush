The project "Energy Rush: Solar Sprint" is in the planning phase. The game specifications have been documented in several files:

1. `game_specs/energy_rush.md` - Contains the overall game concept, mechanics, and technical architecture
2. `game_specs/game_mechanics.md` - Detailed breakdown of core game mechanics
3. `game_specs/implementation_plan.md` - Comprehensive implementation plan with phases

The Memory Bank has been initialized to maintain context across development sessions.

Next steps according to the implementation plan:
- Finalize game design aspects
- Create a basic prototype of core mechanics
- Select the game engine (Phaser.js or Unity)
- Set up the tech stack
